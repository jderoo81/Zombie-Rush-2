            <h5>The game Zombie rush is an unfished top down shooter built in unity. the game is a 2D and works with a player represented by a circle 
                with a stick that repesents the gun. the player will aim where the mouse is pointing and will also move around. at this time there is 
                nothing to shoot yet as the zombies have not been added. although the integration of them will be quite easy as the bullets aready have 
                dedicated shooting and collsion scripts as well as a collision detector. the game game be downloaded from the git repository and run on unity 
                with the correct unity editor version. that version being 2021.3.19f . if the game doesnt quite run at first remeber to try reimorting the 
                assets and trying to run it again.
