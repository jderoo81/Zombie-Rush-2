# Zombie Rush 2
 Simple mini game I created to practice unity 
 it is a top down shooter with a player who can move around aims at the mouse and can shoot
 
 there is also a wiki located in the project file named wiki.html this will provide some background information about the game and it current development progress

there are a couple bugs I need to fix: 
  - Firebase doesn't recoginze it as a project as I need to update to google play services although the project is set up and initialized through the firebase CLI
  - and it is kinda tricky to host a unity game
  - When you build the player circle disapears
  - also there are no zombies yet but I will add those soon
  -
